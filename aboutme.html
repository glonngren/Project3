  <section class="aboutme">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        My name is George Lonngren, I am 27 years old and I live in the West suburbs
        of Chicago in a town called Lombard, Illinois. I was born and raised in the 
        West Suburbs and graduated High School from Willowbrook HS in Villa Park, IL.
        Through out High School, I had kept a promise to myself that I would serve in 
        the military after witnessing the attacks on 9/11 in New York, Pennsylvania
        and Washington D.C. I graduated high school early to join the United States
        Marine Corps.

      <p>
        In 2009 I enlisted as a Communications Equipment Repairer.
        I've fixed almost any type of communications gear that plugs into a wall,
        from XBOX 360s to rotary telephones. After serving five years in the 
        Marines, I was honorably discharged and became a field engineer in the oil
        fields of Oklahoma. I was personally involved in the construction of over
        one-hundred wells. After oil prices dropped, I was laid off and made the 
        decision to go to college, and thats where I am today. I hope to earn
        a bachelor's degree in Information Technology Management with a focus
        in software development.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <div class="programming">
      <p>
        I got my start in programming in the Marine Corps when a project
        was started to develop automated test routines that would trouble-shoot
        UHF (ultra high frequency) radios and decrease turn around time
        in the maintenance cycle. I was personally tasked to create a basic 
        configuration test that would set up a CISCO digital VOIP switch and 
        test whether it could handle a fully configured digital network of phones.
        Utilizing Python, I developed a test-routine and basic GUI to allow
        Marines to test digital switches and decrease the maintenance cycle time
        by weeks. This accomplishment developed in me an interest in programming
        and my desire to become a software engineer is still burning within me to
        this day.
